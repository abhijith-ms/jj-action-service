# Test Automatic Deployment

## After connecting GitHub to Vercel:

### Test the automatic deployment:

1. Make a small change to test deployment
2. Commit and push the change
3. Watch Vercel automatically deploy

### Example test change:

```bash
# Make a small change (like updating a comment in README.md)
echo "<!-- Test deployment -->" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Test: Verify automatic deployment"
git push origin main
```

### What should happen:
- Vercel will detect the push
- Start building automatically
- Deploy to production
- Send you a notification

### Check deployment status:
- Visit your Vercel dashboard
- See the deployment progress
- Get the new deployment URL

### Your URLs after connection:
- **Production**: https://jj-action-services.vercel.app (cleaner URL)
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/abhijith-ms/jj-action-service
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/abhijith-mss-projects/jj-action-services
